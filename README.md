# Reusbale D3 charts

This is an ongoing collection of reusable D3 charts to help you kickstart your data visualization project. The repo currently inlcudes the following types of charts:

**_Static:_**
* Pie chart
* Histogram
* Line chart
* Bar chart

**_Dynamic:_**
* Pie chart
* Histogram
* Line chart

**_Interactive:_**
* Force-directed graph

The repo is structured by chart name (i.e. pie chart), and further broken down by chart type (i.e. dynamic). Each chart has an example and a skeleton, the former being an implementation of the chart that's ready to go (with random data) and the latter being a barebones script for you to fill in parameters.

**See the charts in action at [Typeload](https://typeload.com)**

Feel free to use the code with attribution so others can find these easy-to-use setups. Notify us of any bugs/issues you find or requests for new charts! Cheers
